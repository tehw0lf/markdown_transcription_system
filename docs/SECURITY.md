# Security Policy

## üîí Security Considerations

The Universal Markdown Audio Transcription System is designed with privacy and security as core principles. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security issues.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy by Design

### Local Processing
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: All transcription happens locally on your machine
- **No API Keys Required**: No external services or accounts needed
- **No Data Transmission**: Audio files never leave your device
- **No Telemetry**: No usage data is collected or transmitted

### Data Handling
- **File Permissions**: Respects system file permissions
- **Temporary Files**: Secure cleanup of temporary processing files
- **Log Security**: Logs contain no sensitive audio content
- **Configuration Safety**: Configuration files are stored locally

## üîê Security Features

### File System Security
- **Path Validation**: All file paths are validated and sanitized
- **Directory Traversal Protection**: Prevents access outside configured directories
- **Permission Checks**: Verifies read/write permissions before processing
- **Lock Files**: Prevents multiple instances from conflicting

### Process Security
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Whisper runs in controlled environment
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak system information
- **Input Validation**: All configuration inputs are validated

### System Integration
- **User Isolation**: Runs under user context, not system
- **No Root Required**: Normal user permissions sufficient
- **Systemd Security**: Service files include security restrictions
- **Log Rotation**: Prevents log files from growing unbounded

## üö® Threat Model

### Threats We Protect Against
1. **Data Exfiltration**: Audio content being sent to external services
2. **Path Traversal**: Malicious file paths accessing unauthorized areas
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Large files consuming excessive system resources
4. **Configuration Injection**: Malicious configuration values
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized system access

### Out of Scope
- **Physical Security**: Physical access to the machine
- **OS-level Vulnerabilities**: Operating system security is user's responsibility
- **Network Security**: Network configuration and firewall rules
- **Malware Protection**: Antivirus and anti-malware solutions

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify checksums when downloading
sha256sum markdown-audio-transcription.tar.gz

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Keep dependencies updated
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configuration Security
```yaml
# Use absolute paths
vault_path: "/home/user/Documents/Notes"

# Secure log locations
log_file: "/home/user/.local/share/markdown-transcription/app.log"

# Don't use system directories
temp_dir: "/tmp/markdown-transcription"
```

#### File System Security
```bash
# Set appropriate file permissions
chmod 600 config.yaml
chmod 700 ~/.config/markdown-transcription/

# Regular security updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### For Administrators

#### System Service Security
```ini
# Systemd service security settings
[Service]
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=false
ReadWritePaths=/home/user/Notes
```

#### Network Security
```bash
# No network access required, but if using network storage:
# Ensure secure mounting of network drives
# Use encrypted connections (SFTP, etc.)
```

#### Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor log files for suspicious activity
sudo journalctl -u markdown-transcription.service -f

# Regular security audits
sudo find /home/user/Notes -type f -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "suspicious_pattern" {} \;
```

## üö´ Common Security Mistakes

### ‚ùå Don't Do This
```yaml
# DON'T: Use root directories
vault_path: "/root/notes"

# DON'T: Use system temp directories without subdirectories
temp_dir: "/tmp"

# DON'T: Store logs in world-writable locations
log_file: "/tmp/app.log"

# DON'T: Use overly permissive file permissions
# chmod 777 config.yaml  # NEVER DO THIS
```

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead
```yaml
# DO: Use user home directories
vault_path: "/home/user/Documents/Notes"

# DO: Use application-specific temp directories
temp_dir: "/tmp/markdown-transcription"

# DO: Store logs in user-specific locations
log_file: "/home/user/.local/share/markdown-transcription/app.log"

# DO: Use restrictive file permissions
# chmod 600 config.yaml
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

```yaml
# Security-focused configuration
vault_path: "/home/user/Documents/Notes"
temp_dir: "/tmp/markdown-transcription"
log_file: "/home/user/.local/share/markdown-transcription/app.log"

# Restrict processing to known safe extensions
audio_extensions: [".mp3", ".wav", ".m4a", ".flac"]
video_extensions: [".mp4", ".mkv", ".avi", ".mov"]

# Enable detailed logging for security auditing
log_level: "INFO"
file_logging: true
console_logging: false

# Prevent unauthorized file access
owner_user: "your_username"
owner_group: "your_group"
```

### Security Validation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# security-check.sh - Basic security validation

echo "Security Check for Markdown Transcription System"
echo "================================================"

# Check file permissions
echo "Checking file permissions..."
if [ -f "config.yaml" ]; then
    PERMS=$(stat -c "%a" config.yaml)
    if [ "$PERMS" -gt 600 ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: config.yaml has overly permissive permissions ($PERMS)"
        echo "   Run: chmod 600 config.yaml"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ config.yaml permissions are secure"
    fi
fi

# Check for sensitive data in logs
echo "Checking for sensitive data in logs..."
if [ -f "$HOME/.local/share/markdown-transcription/app.log" ]; then
    if grep -q "password\|secret\|key" "$HOME/.local/share/markdown-transcription/app.log"; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Potential sensitive data found in logs"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ No sensitive data found in logs"
    fi
fi

# Check temp directory
echo "Checking temp directory..."
if [ -d "/tmp/markdown-transcription" ]; then
    OWNER=$(stat -c "%U" /tmp/markdown-transcription)
    if [ "$OWNER" != "$USER" ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Temp directory owned by $OWNER, not $USER"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ Temp directory ownership is correct"
    fi
fi

echo "Security check complete!"
```
